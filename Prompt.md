##### Last updated Spring 2018

## Introduction
### Topics Covered
- Tree terminology
- Tree definitions in C#
- Tree traversals
- Depth-first and breadth-first traversal
- Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal

## Mini-lecture

**Lots of things are trees.**

Examples - the interpreter code.

## Worksheet

You've been given a `BinaryTreeClass` and an interface `ITraverser` which contains a single method `Traverse`. `Traverse` (should) return the string generated by the traversal of a given tree with a particular traversal pattern.
We've also written unit tests for each of the four traversal patterns that we've told you about so far: breadth-first and pre-, in-, and postorder depth-first traversal. Each of those unit tests is currently failing because it's using the `IncorrectTraverser` class as its `ITraverser`.

### Your Task:
- Create four new classes, each of which implements that interface `ITraverser`
- Each of these should traverse a `BinaryTree` in one of the four patterns outlined above
- Fix the code in TreeTraversalTests.cs so that each test method uses an `ITraverser` of the appropriate type

## Microquiz

1. List the order (in terms of Root, LeftChild, RightChild) that nodes are visited in pre-, in-, and postorder depth-first traversal. (5 words max. for each order ("Left Child" is two words))

2. What broad category of data structure would you use for implementing depth-first traversal? What about breadth-first traversal? (1 word each)

3. For the tree below, write the strings printed by breadth-first and preoder, inorder, and postorder depth-first traversal.
                
        G       
       - -      
      /   \     
     /     \    
    /       \   
    E       F   
    -       -   
   / \     / \  
  /   \   /   \ 
 /     \ /     \
 A     B C     D
